> In the last two decades, the long-standing promise of service-based software has been realized, transitioning from traditional client-server architecture to distributed, service-based systems. Applications built upon these systems dynamically compose services from multiple, often unknown, parties to exchange vast amounts of data and collaboratively define and optimize new business processes (e.g., federated learning in the medical field). As these applications become increasingly complex and new regulations emerge, participating services must understand each other's functional and non-functional behavior before joining the application, ensuring that their requirements are met. This scenario is reviving the trust issue that emerged with the advent of the commercial Internet in the 90s. Contrary to the past, trust must now empower collaborative, dynamic, open distributed applications rather than static, client-server transactions. This paper proposes a Trust Management System (TMS) that addresses the specific needs of distributed service-based applications. It implements a trust negotiation protocol that supports partial negotiation to maximize negotiation success and ensures trust establishment over time and across service changes. The proposed approach is applied in the context of a Federated Learning (FL) composite application that studies the long-term effects of COVID-19 and is experimentally evaluated in a comprehensive simulated environment.
